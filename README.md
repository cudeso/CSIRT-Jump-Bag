# Incident Response Laptop

* Hardware
  * Processor: Intel Core i7 or i9, with at least eight cores
  * Memory: 64GB DDR4
  * Harddrive: M2 NVME SSD (for speed) with 1TB storage
  * 2x USB3.1 and 1x USB-C
  * Screen size doesn't really matter, you can use an external screen
* Operating system
  * Host operating system doesn't really matter as none of the IR work is done on the host operating system
  * Windows 10 or Ubuntu Linux
* Non-domain-joined laptop
* Access to the laptop must be protected with a username/password
* Full disk encryption is highly advised
* Three partitions
  * **System** partition, with the host operating system
  * **Data** partition, with the virtual machines
  * **Evidence** partition, used to transfer evidences from USB or other sources
    * This partition is always wiped when an investigation is finished
* **Hypervisor** Install virtualisation software. All forensic work is done via on in virtualised environment. Make sure the laptop BIOS supports an hyporvisor.
  * VMWare (Workstation / Fusion)
  * After the installation of the virtual machines, always create a "CLEAN" snapshot (label it correctly). 

## Virtual machines

On IR-laptop
* FLARE workstation
* SIFT workstation
* Ubuntu VM with Autopsy
* (optional) Ubuntu VM with MISP and TheHive

### Windows 10 base image 

* Download Windows 10 image from Microsoft https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10ISO
* Use this ISO to setup FLARE, or other Windows 10 machines to run or evaluate samples
* Create the VM in the **Data** partition
* Setup Windows 10 with a local account. Include privacy hardening settings
* Install all updates
* Install VMware Tools
* Reboot
* Set the time zone to UTC. This is a general best practice for conducting forensic analysis and ensures a standard time zone is being used across all tools.
* Configure Windows Explorer to show hidden files. Open File Explorer -> View -> check “Hidden items” and “File name extensions”.
* Create a snapshot

### FLARE

Installation takes about 3h to complete.

* Create a full clone from base Windows 10 VM
* Disable Tamper Protection and Defender
  * https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/prevent-changes-to-security-settings-with-tamper-protection-31d51aaa-645d-408e-6ce7-8d7f8e593f87
